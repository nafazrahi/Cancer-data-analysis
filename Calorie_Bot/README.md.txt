üì∏ Calorie Counter Bot
A smart Telegram bot built with n8n that analyzes food photos to provide instant calorie and fat content information. This project showcases the power of workflow automation and AI integration for practical, real-world tasks.

üöÄ Key Features
Instant Analysis: Simply send a photo of your meal to the bot to get a detailed nutritional breakdown.

AI-Powered: Integrates with a Generative AI model (Google Gemini) for accurate calorie and fat content estimations.

Easy to Use: A seamless, conversational interface through Telegram.

No-Code/Low-Code: Built entirely using the visual workflow automation tool, n8n.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The workflow is triggered when a user sends a photo to the Telegram bot. It then:

Downloads the Photo: Retrieves the image from the Telegram chat.

Analyzes with AI: Sends the image to the Google Gemini API with a custom prompt to identify the food and estimate its calories and fat content.

Sends a Response: Formats the AI's response into a friendly, conversational message and sends it back to the user on Telegram.
